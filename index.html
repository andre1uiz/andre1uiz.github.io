      <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
      <p>Electronic engineer at Faculdade Anhanguera and electronic technician at ETEC Júlio de Mesquita.
        Currently, I am living in Colombia and working as a Technical Comercial Business Developer at SICK, a
        worldwide technology german company
        that develops solutions focused on sensors. Here, I develop applications and train our customers to update or
        enable them on the use of new products and technologies.
      </p>
      <p>Before that, I was Market Application Engineer for the same company in Brazil. There, I worked mainly with
        machine vision, data acquisition, machine safety and distance sensor applications, developing standard and
        customized solutions at our customers using 4.0 industry elements and helping them to solve the most variable
        challenges in their processes. I also develop tailormade solutions through programmed devices - languages Lua,
        CSS and HTML - perform presentations and train our sales teams and customers on products and solutions.</p>
      <p>Also at this same company in Brazil, I was a Technical Assistance Analyst, where I worked in projects with
        national and international partners, external services, training customers and providing technical support local
        by phone.</p>
      <p>Nowadays I am developing habilities with .Lua and Python programming and also learning about machine learning.
      </p>
      <p>Besides work and study, I also like to play bass / guitar and hang out with my friends and family :) .</p>

      <h3>My first project</h3>
      <div class="project-tile">
        <p>The first programming project that I made was for learning purposes. In the period of this project I was
          working with AI developed tools from SICK and to improve myself I started some online classes about Machine
          Learning using Python - Pandas.</p>
        <p>Because the programming language from the company was Lua and to use its machine vision products, I used the
          learning from the classes to apply a simple machine learning algorithm on a 2D camera using the Lua libraries
          available embedded on the device</p>
        <p>Basically, the program has the image adjustment functions from the camera and a ML classification tool, where
          you can add labels and train images to properly perform the inference.</p>
        <p>Because it was made only for study purposes, the algorithm uses the histogram from each image to learn
          instead of its pixels values. Due to this it is ok to assume that this program is not very robust to work on a
          valid application. Nevertheless, it was presented on an online fair in Brazil during the pandemic to show the
          ML tool from the camera.</p>
